This repository demonstrates a common error in COBOL loops: double incrementing the loop counter.  The `bug.cob` file shows the faulty code where the counter `WS-COUNTER` is incremented both within the `PERFORM` loop and in the loop's termination condition. This causes the loop to skip iterations or terminate prematurely.  The solution, `bugSolution.cob`, demonstrates the corrected version where the counter is incremented only once, within the loop.
